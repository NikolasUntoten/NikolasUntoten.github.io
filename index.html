            Hello, I'm Nikolas Gaub. This is my personal website. If you are viewing this page on
            teletran-2.net, than congratulations! You're being served a file directly from a tower I built,
            from software I wrote (in C++, using POSIX functions). This website is mostly used for showing off
            my easily demonstratable personal projects. Feel free to poke around, but please keep in mind that
            I am not a front end developer. Some of the projects shown here have been adapted to a website format,
            rather than having been created that way. If you have any questions, please find my contact information
            below.
        </p>
