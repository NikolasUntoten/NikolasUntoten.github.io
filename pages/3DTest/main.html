            <p>
                Below, you can see a 3D rendering engine that I developed from scratch (originally in java, and adapted to javascript).
                When I say from scratch, I mean it. No libraries (aside
                from jquery) were used here, and everything is being drawn using built in html canvas functions. I developed all rendering
                algorithms myself (mostly through a lot of though, and trial and error). The only part that is not my own original work
                is a function for rotating a point about another point in 3D space, because this was a readily available equation.
